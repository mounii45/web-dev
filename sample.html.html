    <p class="pright">Once upon a time, there was a king; who used to wear a single horned crown.<br> He had a lavish palace, three beautiful wives, and seven children; all well<br> qualified in their respective fields. The king was reaching the retirement age,<br>
         so he asked his elder son to lead his empire so that he could undergo seclusion.<br>
          Now, his Elder Son, Jonathan had set other plans for himself. So he turned down<br>
           his father’s offer. Jonathan was a nature lover; and he wished to live in a thatched<br> 
           house within the deepest parts of the jungle. The king was disheartened; but he<br> 
           accepted Jonathan’s plea.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>He asked Jonathan’s immediate junior brother Sharlie to handle the loads of the throne.<br>
         Sharlie accepted; but on a clause – whenever Jonathan would change his mind, Sharlie<br>
          would return his throne to him. He took oath by scratching his hand. The blood that dropped
           at the ground transformed into a marble structure of an immensely beautiful fairy. Both 
           Jonathan & Sharlie were so mesmerized with this incident that they called the
            head priest to decipher the incident.The Head Priest was an old learned man.<br>
            He observed the fairy structure. She was carrying an innocent smile in her lips; but <br>
            a tear drop was falling from one of her eyes. After seven days of extensive prayers and <br>
            research, the priest concluded; “This kingdom was once the land of these fairies.<br>
             Then Our  Beloved Single Horned King took over this part. The fairies went <br>
             underground and lived their  peacefully. Our bona fide King had never any intension<br>
              to harm them. The fairies brought so much good luck to our Kingdom. Peace prevailed in<br>
               every corner. But now, with the single drop of blood that hit the ground, the world of <br>
               Fairies had an abrupt end. They all turned into marble structures; and the Fairest of all <br>
               Fairies emerged into the palace with her frozen drop of tear. Their curse now will fall upon us. And the whole kingdom will vanquish within the next Full moon!”</p>
